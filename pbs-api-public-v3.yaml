          description: "Description of therapeutic groups represented by an ATC Code. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system is a measuring unit recommended by the WHO for drug utilisation monitoring and research. Drugs are divided into groups according to the organ or body system on which they act and their chemical, pharmacological and therapeutic properties. The PBS uses the ATC system for categorising PBS medicines into therapeutic groups in the PBS Schedule.  \r\nStructure  \r\n   Active substances classified in a hierarchy with five different levels. \r\n  - *1st level* - fourteen main anatomical/pharmacological groups. \r\n  - *2nd level* - pharmacological or therapeutic subgroups. \r\n  - *3rd level* - chemical, pharmacological or therapeutic subgroups.\r\n  - *4th level* - chemical, pharmacological or therapeutic subgroups.\r\n  - *5th level* - chemical substance.   \r\n            \r\nThe 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels are often used to identify pharmacological subgroups when that is considered more appropriate than therapeutic or chemical subgroups.   \r\nCode Description example - *A01AA01*\r\n- *A* Alimentary tract and metabolism\r\n- *A01* Stomatological preparations\r\n- *A01A* Stomatological preparations\r\n- *A01AA* Caries prophylactic agents\r\n- *A01AA01* Sodium fluoride"

Any applicable special patient contributions, brand premiums or therapeutic group premiums must still be met by the patient, and do not count towards the Safety Net. \r\nThe Safety Net threshold is reached by accumulating eligible patient contributions for PBS prescriptions supplied through community pharmacies and private hospitals and for non-PBS out-patient medication supplied by public hospitals."

Generally, F1 is intended for single brand drugs and F2 for drugs that have multiple brands or are in a therapeutic group with other drugs with multiple brands. Drugs on F2 are subject to the provisions of the Act relating to statutory price reductions, price disclosure and guarantee of supply.  \r\n- *F1* or *F2* - is determined by the National Health (Listed Drugs on F1 or F2) Determination 2021 \r\n- *CDL* - Single brand combination drugs. \r\n- *F2A* and *F2T* - old terms that no longer exist as of 2011. These were used to facilitate PBS reforms/reductions. So F2A and F2T are now collectively F2. \r\n- *Null* - all items not subject to the provisions of the Act.
